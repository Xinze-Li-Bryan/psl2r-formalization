# Orientation-Preserving Isometry Group of the Hyperbolic Plane

This file defines Isom⁺(ℍ²), the group of orientation-preserving isometries
of the hyperbolic plane.

## Main definitions

* `IsomPlusH`: The group of orientation-preserving isometries of ℍ

## Implementation notes

An isometry of ℍ is a distance-preserving bijection. We focus on the subgroup
that preserves orientation.

Mathlib already proves that SL(2,ℝ) acts by isometries on the upper half plane.

## References

* Mathlib has isometry definitions in `Mathlib.Topology.MetricSpace.Isometry`
* The metric on ℍ is in `Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.UpperHalfPlane.Metric`
