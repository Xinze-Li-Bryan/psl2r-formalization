# Unit Tangent Bundle of the Hyperbolic Plane

This file defines the unit tangent bundle T¹ℍ of the hyperbolic plane.

## Main definitions

* `T1H`: The unit tangent bundle of the upper half plane (simplified version)

## Implementation notes

The unit tangent bundle consists of pairs (z, v) where:
- z ∈ ℍ is a point in the upper half plane
- v is a unit tangent vector at z with respect to the hyperbolic metric

The hyperbolic metric on ℍ is already defined in
`Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.UpperHalfPlane.Metric`.

## References

* Mathlib has `UpperHalfPlane.dist` giving the hyperbolic metric
