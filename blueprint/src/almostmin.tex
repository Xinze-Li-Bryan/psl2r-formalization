\begin{definition}[Almost minimizing]\label{def:am}
A surface $\Sigma$ is $\varepsilon$-a.m. in $U$ if there is no isotopy supported in $U$ which keeps area within $\varepsilon/8$ along the path and decreases the final area by at least $\varepsilon$. \uses{}

\begin{lemma}[Convergence regularity]\label{lem:conv-reg}
\lean{MinimalSurfaces.convergence_regularity}
If a min--max sequence converges in the varifold sense, its limit contains a smooth embedded minimal surface. \uses{def:varifold-conv}
